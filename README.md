# Django Website for Sampling from High Dimensional Space

This repository contains the integration of [sampling from high dimensional space with complex, non-linear constraints](https://github.com/karthikncsu/Sampling-from-high-dimensional-space) program into Django web framework to demo the sampler. The website provides options of selecting one of the methods from the following four methods

1) Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
2) Gibbs Sampler (Gibbs)
3) Adaptive Metropolis (AdaptiveMetropolis)
4) Metropolis Random Walk (Metropolis)

and one of the following examples can be selected

1) Mixture
2) Example
3) Formulation
4) Alloy
